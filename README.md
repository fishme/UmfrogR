# UmfrogR
This repository will be used for the development of the "UmfrogR" app, a universal app built by the members of the Apache Cordova Meetup Group in Berlin (see http://www.meetup.com/de/Berliner-Apache-Cordova-Network).

This repository will contain both the front-end (written as a universal app using ionics/cordova) and the back-end.
